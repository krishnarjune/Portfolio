* &nbspI am seeking a position that will help me to bridge the gap between education and professional experience.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp I am close to graduating with a bachelors in information technology and I plan to pursue a masters in software<br>
&nbsp &nbsp engineering next. <br><br>

* &nbspHaving reviewed the requirements for software engineering positions at leading tech companies,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp I realize I need to gain several years of experience in the software development field to reach my goal.<br> 
&nbsp &nbsp I am currently looking for positions that will give me an opportunity to work more closely with <br>
&nbsp &nbsp software engineering teams and/or gain experience using the software development skills I have learned through<br>
&nbsp &nbsp school. <br><br>

* &nbspI am also looking to gain specific programming skills not covered by my degree. I am familiar with both<br>
&nbsp &nbsp front-end and back-end services however my true interest is in MacOS programming. I am interested in<br>
&nbsp &nbsp opportunities which will help me to gain experience in Objective-C, C++, and Swift.
